# Gym Workout and Buddy Tracker
Hello World!

This is my first Full Stack Project using the MERN Stack. I have used React with JS for the frontend, MongoDB for the NoSQL Backend, and also used Node.js and Express for the backend and frontend interactions. 

This web app allows you to create workout documents that you can track and update as you go on about your Workout Journey.
